## **Project installation**
### Using Docker

Our project can be run using docker as we have created a docker image. To do this, please download Docker desktop and then follow the following steps. 

1. docker pull jesse24/foodcomm:latest
2. docker run -d -p port:5001 jesse24/foodcomm

Replace port with any number preferably above 10,000 to avoid conflicting ports with your system. Here is an example

docker run -d -p 15000:5001 jesse24/foodcomm

3. go to localhost:port
	
Simply open your localhost at the port you have specified earlier. So if you used the  example, go to localhost:15000

### From the Github: https://github.com/lilousicard/CS157C-Team6

If for some reason the docker image isnâ€™t working, or you would like to run our code from the github instead, follow these instructions. Make sure you have python3 installed as well as the following python libraries: Flask, Jinja2, Py2neo, passlib. 

1. Git clone https://github.com/lilousicard/CS157C-Team6.git
2. Inside the root directly simply run: python main.py or python3 main.py depending on your python installation. 
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5001
